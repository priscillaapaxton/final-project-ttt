### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
This application is my final project for Module One of Turing's Front End Software Development program. I worked on it for approximately 30 hours.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
This application utilizes object-oriented programming to maintain the status of any given game. It is written with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The basic architecture of this application are class files for both the players and game; each with their respective methods that maintain the datamodel, as well as a main file that relies on the datamodel to visually display the information. This application also demonstrates my improved capabilities in CSS styling.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
This project was my first experience working with a game and it was equally as enjoyable as it was challenging. I did extensive planning of how I wanted to store and update the game's data before building the program which made the code writing process streamlined. I'd never worked with a data object this large, so it was an extensive process to create and consistently modify each method to respond appropriately to every possible outcome of the game. The main JavaScript file also contains numerous atomic functions to visually display the game's numerous outcomes. Separate from the functionality of the game, this project also represents my growth in CSS styling capabilities. I strived to make this application visually engaging. I tried to be intentional with my design.
